# philo_old
My older version of Philosophers project.

Here, "last time ate" is updated when a philosopher has finished eating.

Another issue was that the philosophers weren't necessarily waiting for each other before starting their routine.

The new version with a lot of optimisation and all the issues fixed can be found [**here**](https://github.com/Ysoroko/Philosophers)
